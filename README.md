# SmartReticle

A crosshair overlay for Windows that shows only while you are actually playing. Built for **The Division 2**. It is an Electron app with a tactical HUD interface.

## Run it

- Packaged: `dist\SmartReticle-win32-x64\SmartReticle.exe`
- From source: `npm install`, then `npm start`

If npm's install-script blocker skips Electron's download, run `node node_modules/electron/install.js` once.

## Division 2 setup

1. In the game's video settings, set the window mode to **Windowed** at your monitor's resolution.
2. Leave **Force borderless** on (Settings tab). SmartReticle removes the window frame and stretches the game over the monitor. Division 2 has no borderless mode, and no overlay can draw over exclusive fullscreen.
3. Play. The crosshair hides when you alt-tab, minimise the game, or open a menu that shows the mouse cursor. `F8` toggles it at any time, and the key still reaches the game.

If the debug log says `Borderless: FAILED`, the game runs as administrator. Run SmartReticle as administrator too.

## Tabs

- **Crosshair**: 7 shapes, colour, size, gap, thickness, outline, opacity and a pixel nudge. The live preview has game-like backdrops at actual size, 3× and 6× zoom. Save several crosshairs as profiles, start from presets, and copy or paste share codes (`SR2-…`; old `SR1-…` codes also load).
- **Settings**: Division 2 setup steps, the game list, and the rules:
  - Force borderless
  - Hide in menus
  - Only show while the mouse is locked: Division 2 locks the mouse to the screen centre during play and frees it on the map and in menus, even while you drag the map
  - Hide when the game draws its own cursor (experimental, off by default)
  - Auto-detect fullscreen games
  - Aim mode (`Always`, `Hide while aiming`, `Only while aiming`), with a configurable aim key
  - Show delay
  - On/off hotkey, Launch with Windows (packaged build only), Start in the tray, and the debug log
Closing the window leaves the overlay running from the tray. Use the tray menu to quit.

## Safety

SmartReticle uses only public Windows calls:
- the focused window and its process name (from a process snapshot, never `OpenProcess`)
- the cursor state and clip rectangle
- key state
- window-style changes for force-borderless

It never injects into or reads the game's memory. Check the game's rules anyway.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `main.cjs` | Windows, tray, the detection loop (60 Hz while the game is focused, 20 Hz otherwise), IPC. The settings window is created when opened and destroyed when closed. |
| `engine/` | `win32.cjs` (koffi bindings), `detector.cjs`, `borderless.cjs`, `logic.cjs` (pure rules), `settings.cjs`, `log.cjs` |
| `renderer/` | Settings UI (`index.html`, `app.js`, `ui-controls.js`, `styles.css`), click-through overlay (`overlay.html/js`), and `crosshair-draw.js`, which both share |
| `test/` | `npm test`: 20 `node --test` cases |
| `scripts/snapshot.cjs` | `npm run snapshot`: screenshots every tab |
| `prototype-csharp/` | The first native version. Its `bin\CursorLab.exe game\|menu\|softmenu\|rawgame\|windowed` fakes each game state for testing. |

`npm run package` builds `dist\SmartReticle-win32-x64`.
